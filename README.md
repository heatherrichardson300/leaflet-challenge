# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet.js

## Overview

This project visualizes real-time earthquake data provided by the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**. The goal is to create an interactive map to display earthquake information, helping educate the public and support decision-making.

Using **Leaflet.js**, the visualization plots earthquake locations, with marker sizes based on magnitude and colors representing depth, allowing for easy interpretation of the data.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Displays global earthquake data using latitude and longitude.
- **Magnitude-Based Markers**: Marker sizes scale with earthquake magnitude.
- **Depth-Based Coloring**: Colors indicate earthquake depth, with darker colors for greater depths.
- **Information Popups**: Clickable markers show detailed earthquake information (e.g., magnitude, location, depth).
- **Custom Legend**: Provides context for the depth-based color coding.
